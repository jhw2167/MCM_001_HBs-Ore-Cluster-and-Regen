# 01_MC-Mods_HBs-Ore-Clusters-and-Regen
An entry in Holy Bucket's Minecraft Forge mod series. HBâ€™s Ore Clusters and Regen is a mod that spawns large to massive clusters of ore in the world in addition to the small vanilla ore veins players are used to. These ore clusters will also regenerate over a period of days so the clusters can be harvested again, boosting resource production and incentivizing the player to set up multiple small bases around the world, and interconnect them.
